# Omni

Omni is a Python-based autonomous Minecraft agent that connects to a Minecraft server, observes the surrounding world, leverages a Local LLM for cognitive decision-making, and executes actions through a deterministic task-tracking and tool system.

The project combines:
- A **Mineflayer-backed** Minecraft client (Python-to-Node bridge),
- An **Ollama-powered** cognitive loop,
- A **deterministic task planner** and execution progress tracker,
- A **modular tool registry** for autonomous movement, vision, communication, and block interaction.

## Ecosystem & Companion Apps

- **[Minecraft World Model Viewer](https://github.com/GaleevArslanDev/omni-world-state-visualizer)** — A dedicated Panda3D desktop companion application used to monitor and visualize Omni's live `world_state.json` updates in real-time.

## How It Works

On each step, the agent execution loop:
1. Observes the world coordinates and environment around it.
2. Updates the internal `WorldState` and evaluates `TaskProgress`.
3. Constructs a contextual prompt for the Local LLM.
4. Receives exactly one tool call response formatted in JSON.
5. Executes the selected tool via the registry.
6. Records the result and continues until the objective is met or the step limit is reached.

The current toolset allows the agent to handle tasks such as:
- Moving forward for a fixed duration.
- Changing body orientation (turning left/right).
- Locking gaze at specific coordinates or nearby blocks.
- Broadcasting text updates in the game chat.
- Mining the specific block currently under the crosshair.
- Tracking and recalling object locations for multi-step goals.

## Core Milestones (Version History)

- **`v0.5.0` (Current)**: Transitioned task logic to a strict algorithmic layer, isolating execution tracking from LLM hallucination.
- **`v0.4.0`**: Introduced the `WorldState` persistence memory layer and offloaded delta observation tracking away from the LLM context.
- **`v0.3.0`**: Implemented core environment interaction via the `digging` tool registry.
- **`v0.2.0`**: Added spatial block-scanning capabilities and surrounding world perception.
- **`v0.1.0`**: Configured basic locomotion, physics-based 3D rotation, and movement.
- **`v0.0.0`**: Initial text-based agent architecture framework.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js
- Active Minecraft Java server (recommended version `1.20.1`)
- Locally installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance
- The `qwen3:8b` model available via Ollama

*Note: The repository currently does not include a `requirements.txt` or `package.json`. Node and Python dependencies must be fetched manually.*

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages and the Node bridge:
```bash
pip install ollama javascript
npm install mineflayer
```

### 2. Fetch the Local LLM
Ensure your local Ollama instance is active and download the model specified in `llm.py`:
```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
```

### 3. Server Configuration
By default, the client in `clients/minecraft/client.py` connects using the following parameters:
- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `3000`
- **Version**: `1.20.1`
- **Username**: `Omni`

Modify this configuration file directly if your Minecraft server uses alternative connection tokens.

## Running the Agent

Launch the main cognitive loop:
```bash
python main.py
```
Type your goal directly into the console prompt when requested. 

**Example Prompts:**
- *“Move forward for 3 seconds”*
- *“Remember the chest, move forward for 2 seconds, and tell me where the chest was”*

## Current Development Notes

- **Language Stance**: Some core prompt configurations and internal planner evaluation text are written in Russian, though the execution runtime layer remains completely language-agnostic.
- **Observation Flow**: The standalone `observe` tool class is temporarily disabled; environment data extraction is handled natively by the core loop orchestration.
- **Step Limit**: To prevent runaway API costs or infinite loops, the agent is hardcoded to forcefully terminate after 20 sequential tool steps.

## Limitations & Next Steps

- Missing dependency lockfiles (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`).
- Absence of automated testing suites.
- The deterministic planner currently accommodates a restricted set of sequence patterns.
- Connection configurations are static and hardcoded within source files.
